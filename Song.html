            I'm goin' up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?<br>
            I'm goin' up the country, baby, don't you wanna go?<br>
            I'm goin' to someplace where I've never been before<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<br>
            I'm goin', I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine<br>
            I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine<br>
            We can jump in the water, stay drunk all the time<br>
            <br>

            [Verse 3]<br>
            I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away<br>
            I'm gonna leave the city, got to get away<br>
            All this fussin' and fightin', man, you know I sure can't stay<br>
            <br>
            [Bridge]<br>
            Now, baby, pack your leavin' trunk, you know we've got to leave today<br>
            Just exactly where we're goin' I cannot say, but<br>
            We might even leave the USA<br>
            'Cause there's a brand-new game that I don't wanna play<br>

            [Outro]<br>
            No use for you runnin' or screamin' and cryin'<br>
            'Cause you've got a home as long as I've got mine</p>
